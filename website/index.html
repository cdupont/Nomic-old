<p>A Nomic game in Haskell</p>

Nomyx is a unique game where you can change the rules of the game itself, while playing it! 
In fact, changing the rules is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered as a move. Of course even that could be changed! 
The players can submit new rules or modify existing ones, thus completely changing the behaviour of the game through time.
The rules are managed and interpreted by the computer. They must be written in the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Nomyx-Language">Nomyx language</a>, based on <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
This is the first complete implementation of a <a href="http://www.nomic.net">Nomic</a> game on a computer. <br /> 
<br />
At the beginning, the initial rules are describing:<br />

<ul><li>How to add new rules and change existing ones. For example a unanimity vote is necessary to have a new rule accepted.</li>
<li>How to win the game. For example you win the game if you have 5 rules accepted.</li></ul>
But of course even that can be changed!<br />
<br />
Here is a <a href="http://vimeo.com/58265498">video introduction</a> and first tutorial of the game. <br />
<a href="http://www.nomyx.net:8000/Nomyx">The game is running here</a>  <br />
The <a href="http://www.nomyx.net/forum">Forum</a> is used to learn about Nomyx and discuss the rules during a game. <br />
There is a lot of <a href="https://github.com/cdupont/Nomic/blob/master/Nomyx-Language/src/Language/Nomyx/Examples.hs">examples of rules</a> you can propose.

If you want to run Nomyx at home (instead of using the public instance above), follow those instructions:
The software is available on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Nomyx">Hackage</a>.<br />
The development version is available on <a href="https://github.com/cdupont/Nomic">GitHub</a>.<br />
<br />
To install using cabal:<br />
$ cabal install Nomyx<br />
<br />
To run:<br />
$ Nomyx<br />

To create a new game, you need to be admin. Input the password in the advanced page. The default password is "NXPSD". Then on the main page you will be able to create a new game.
